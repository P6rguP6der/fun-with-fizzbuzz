# Fun With FizzBuzz
A collection of FizzBuzz programs written in C, whereas the program itself or its source code is unusually weird, unnecessarily complicated, or otherwise silly.

Each program has its own separate folder.

Unless explicidly specified, each of these programs can be executed on the terminal by following command:

```
$ ./<name-of-program> <number-of-lines>
```

For example:

```
$ ./fizzbuzz-program 16
```

And the output is:

```
1
2
FIZZ
4
BUZZ
FIZZ
7
8
FIZZ
BUZZ
11
FIZZ
13
14
FIZZBUZZ
16
```

(If `<number-of-lines>` part is missing, then the output has 50 lines).

These programs are written for the sake of fun and serve no practical usage in real life.
